* Created a database relational design for the different type of users involved, viz., student, company, alumni and admin.
* Different set of functionalities were created for different type of users.
* The tech stack used was MySQL, PHP, HTML and CSS.

## Admin
* **MySQL terminal** has been provided too since it would be much more convenient for one time usage for certain queries.
* The control of placement allocation, mapping of Student with Company is manually done by the admin. Admin also has the control of ending the placement season, after which all the current students are converted to alumni users.
* **Filtered Search**: Admin can filter out companies as well as students to search for the ones that are obeying the required search criteria such as company name, job roles, ctc for company and cpi, batch and skills for students.

## Alumni
* Alumnis could make up their account in the database and could add their further work experiences.
* This would help the database in keeping updated with its alumni base and further to contact companies.

## Student
* Students could register to the site and filter search the companies based on skills, company name and offer.
* Once a student shows interest, they would be mapped to company.

## Company
* Each company could register with multiple job roles, locations and offers.
* They could search through the students who showed interest in the company, the student's skills, resume and CPI.
