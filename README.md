This project was done so as mitigate the issue of poor TPC portal which doesn't contain the centralized database and actions to be taken. The task was to create a database management system for the Training and Placement Cell.
1) Created a database relational design for the different type of users involved, viz., student, company, alumni and admin.
2) Different set of functionalities were created for different type of users.
3) The tech stack used was MySQL, PHP, HTML and CSS.

#Features of Website:
● Getting back Alumni: The alumni who didn't have the account in TPC
earlier can get registered and keep updating their experience of where
they have worked from when to when, the job role and the ctc.
● Multiple Domain: For applying to companies, the students can choose
multiple domains to apply to and all the companies would be displayed
according to that.
● 4th Normalized form: The company and job_roles tables have been
split to avoid redundancy of information.
● Terminal: A sql terminal has been provided that if the admin is from cs
background they can use the terminal to access the list. And also it
would be much more convenient for one time usage of particular
queries.
● Ending Placement season: This feature automatically clears the
graduated students and puts their data in the alumni table marking their
graduation and the end of placement season.
● Filtered search: We have provided admin with a filtered search option
to see the companies which have applied and fulfills their criterias.
Along with that the admin also has the option to filter search the current
batch to see the eligible candidates or the current scenario.
● Niche search: The admin can also search up the student profile using
the rollno to see their profile.
● Security: The placement confirmation is done by admin itself while
putting the rollno, company, job_role manually which are pushed into
the placement table automatically with their batch_year along with
other batches. This makes sure that there is credibility in the system.
● Company-Student mapping: The company gives their eligibilty and
the company is then only able to see those students who have applied to
the company.
● Statistics: The website tells the admin about the highest ctc package,
the average ctc and total offers gained
And it also shows the bar-graph chart split both branch-wise and
company-wise.
